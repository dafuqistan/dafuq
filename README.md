"The interesting point on WW2 and the referendum is that some of the polling showed that the trend for the older you were, the more likely you were to support Leave broke down once it reached 75-80 year olds and above. (Disclaimer: this was getting into the realm of very small sample sizes, so margins of error were much bigger) What that suggests is that those who had memories of wartime, even as children, knew enough about it to not want to see it again. The post-war generation, raised on tales of how Britain won the war without seeing the cost of it were much more likely to think 'we won the war' was much more important than 'let's never have a war again'."
